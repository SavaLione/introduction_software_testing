# Week 1
## Overview
1. Validation
2. Verification
3. Validation
4. Verification
5. ```It checks the whole system``` and ```It documents system behavior```

## On the difficulty of software testing
1. Continuous systems are simpler to test because you can often extrapolate test results from one point to points 'nearby'.
2. ```A  = 5, X = 5, N = 5``` and ```A  = 1, X = 10, N = 1```
3. Optimistic
4. No

## What is a Test?
1. A program that automatically matches the actual program output to the expected output of the test case.
2. True
3. ```Remove data you added after testing is done``` and ```Close connection after testing is done```
4. Software output is checked by an oracle.
